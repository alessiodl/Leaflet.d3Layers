# Leaflet.d3Layers
<p class="lead">Leaflet.d3Layers is a collection of JavaScript functions used to easily draw <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a> layers on top of a map built with the <a href="http://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a> web mapping library. The principal advantage in using D3 is the possibility to manage large amount of spatial data as SVG object, mantaining very high performances: no more browser freeze or unresponsive maps!</p>
<p style="font-size:70%;">Leaflet.d3Layers is under active development and it is really not recommended for your production environment!</p>
