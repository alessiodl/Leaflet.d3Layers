# Leaflet.d3Layers
Leaflet.d3Layers is a collection of JavaScript functions used to easily draw <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a> layers on top of a map built with <a href="http://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a>. 
The principal advantage in using D3 is the ability to manage large amount of spatial data as SVG object mantaining very high performances: no more browser freeze or unresponsive maps!
Leaflet.d3Layers is under active development and it is really not recommended for your production environment.
